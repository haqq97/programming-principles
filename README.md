Introduction to Programming Design and Concepts Using C++

Annual Growth: Simple Program that takes in user's name, date of birth and height and calculates the average growth in height assuming that the height at birth was 51 cm.

Quadratic Solver: Solves any quadratic equation.

Grade Calculator: calculates the grade for CSCE-121 course gives the grade distribution.

Bulls And Cows: A simple game where one person enters a number to guess and the other user needs to guess that number and thr program tells the user how close the guess was to the actual number. A bull is when a digit in the user's guess is in the exact position and a cow is when the user guesses the right digit but the position is wrong.

Palindromes: This program uses the command line in which any word can be checked if its a palindrome. There are two flags used: -s : to consider spaces -c : to consider case sensitivity

Mountain Paths: This program contains a "greedy" algorithm which finds the most efficient pathway to reach a destination. It reads in elevations from a text file and converts to a ppm file which displays the elevations in greyscale. Then, it computes the greedy algorithm in which the best possible route is taken and the change in elevation is calculated. Then the output file is a ppm file which contains all the possible paths in red and the best one in green. Temperature Queries

Linked List: A linked list was used in this program to organize temperature sensor readings of several locations in Texas from a temps.dat file. Each node in the linked list contains a location, data, and the average temperature recording extracted from the temps.dat file. After organizing all the information in a linked list, a queries.dat file is taken as input which is requests for an average temperature recording or the mode temperature recording for a specific region and a specific range of years. The program then outputs the result in a result.dat file where all the information is listed for each query.

Store Backend: Based on a UML Diagram, classes are constructed to organize a store. There is a class for products, customer and store each having different attributes and methods that help to organize the backend of a store.
